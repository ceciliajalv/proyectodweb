                                                      Held my breath for a decade
                                                      Dyed my hair blue
                                                      To match my lips
                                                      Cool of me to try
                                                      Pretty cool I'm still alive
                                                      I beat it like a dead horse
                                                      I beat it like a drum
                                                      Oh, I stayed with you too long
                                                      Skipping like a record
                                                      I sang along
                                                      To a silly little song
                                                      I said I beat it like a dead horse
                                                      I beat it like a drum
                                                      Oh, I stayed with you too long
                                                      Skipping like a record
                                                      I sang along
                                                      A shitty never ending song
                                                      Sometimes it's good to be
                                                      The bigger person
                                                      But I'm so small I can't compare
                                                      And after all, it's only fair
                                                      Yeah
                                                      I got what I deserved
                                                      I was the other woman first
                                                      Other others on the line
                                                      But I kept trying to make it work
                                                      I beat it like a dead horse
                                                      I beat it like a drum

                                                      When I said goodbye, I hope you cried
                                                      When I said goodbye, I hope you cried

                                                    I won't give in to the fear
                                                    Crystal clear
                                                    I won't give in to the fear
                                                    Crystal clear
                                                    I won't give in to the fear
                                                    Crystal clear
                                                    Here we go
                                                    Gonna risk it again
                                                    Let's hope it's the last time
                                                    We don't know
                                                    How this could end
                                                    Let's hope it won't have to
                                                    Won't have to (hmm)
                                                    Crystal clear
                                                    I won't give in to the fear
                                                    Crystal clear
                                                    I won't give in to the fear
                                                    Crystal clear
                                                    I won't give in to the fear
                                                    Crystal clear
                                                    Won't give into the fear
                                                    It's a feeling
                                                    (Clear) I'm still right here
